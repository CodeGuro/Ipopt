-----------

You can find more information on installing and using this interface
in the Ipopt documentation.
In the best cases, it is sufficient to run 'make' after Ipopt has been
installed successfully.

With 'make test' you can run two example problems.

With 'make doc' you can generate javadoc help.

-----------

Usage:

If you want to use Ipopt from Java, all you need to include is the
org/coinor/Ipopt.class file.  At runtime, there must be the
lib/libjipopt.so file.
